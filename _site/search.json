    "text": "Welcome to the companion website for the Discrete Mathematics textbook1.\nI look forward to feedback on the book as I try to cobble together a first draft over summer. My motivation for this exercise is mainly that teaching undergraduate Discrete Math2 has been one of the most rewarding experiences I‚Äôve had. I owe a lot of this joy to the wonderful books, lectures, and videos I‚Äôve come across in preparation. I now feel like sharing this happiness by collecting my favorites in one place. I also have a vested interest that I imagine is common among people who undertake such projects: the hope is to develop a greater familiarity with the material in the process of trying to put it together :)\nDiscrete Math at the undergraduate level is often taught with a dedicated tutorial slot. Over the years, I have had a lot of fun drawing inspiration from several sources to turn the tutorial sessions into hands-on activities. In particular, I‚Äôve found that playing games, solving puzzles, discussing paradoxes, and performing card magic are engaging ways to revisit and apply ideas from the lectures.\nThe topics of this course also offer a good opportunity to appreciate historical context: the development of many things we now take for granted, whether number systems or paradox-inducing axioms, came about over long periods of deliberations and debate. The role of mathematicians in ancient India in some of these themes is also a matter of intrigue and beauty.\nDiscrete Mathematics is often assigned to the semester where students are also introduced to some flavors of data structures and algorithms, which in turn usually has a lab component. I believe that with a little planning, it is possible to bring out synergies between these courses. I hope to have suggestive pointers for places where there is scope to sync.\nThe Plan: I will be rolling out a chapter every week over summer, starting from the 21st of April. There are seven chapters, each in two parts: the first covers core material that would be suitable for roughly four lectures, and while the extras cover additional trivia and sometimes advanced material suitable for self-study. This companion website will also be used to host interactive demonstrations for some of the activities in the book.\nPlease drop your details on the updates page to recieve an email notification when a new chapter is available. You can also join the Zulip community to participate in discussions around the chapters. Feel free to send me an email at neeldhara.misra@gmail.com if you have any questions, or drop a comment below. Thanks for your interest in this project :)"

    "text": "To participate in the discussion, please join the Zulip community. The text below is reproduced from this post and this one. However, if it‚Äôs simpler, you are also welcome to leave your comments at the end of this page. Thanks!\n\n\n\n\nThe Proposed Narrative\nThis chapter will have the following subsections (the order is not final yet):\n\nSets\nNumbers\nFunctions\nRelations\nRecurrences\nLogic\nNotes\n\n(Note: the last section is mostly references.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInstructor‚Äôs note: this material should correspond to roughly six hours of instruction ‚Äî give or take ‚Äî spread across two weeks. About an hour per section should be workable as a rule of thumb, with appropriate choices made about what‚Äôs to be left out.\n\n\n\n\nWith sets, I plan to give a taste of the ZF axioms, even if not all of them. The current flow is the following:\n\ndefine sets as most people do, as a well-defined collection of objects (the so-called axiom of unrestricted comprehension)\nestablish Russell‚Äôs Paradox\nrestrict the construction of sets by providing context (the axiom of specification)\nrealize that we can‚Äôt define anything now, because we need a set to define a set!\nthis motivates the ‚Äòempty set axiom‚Äô\nwe establish axiom of extension next (the equality of sets by the elements that contain them) to realize that with only the empty set, we are stuck with just the empty set :( ‚Äî note that if extension was not explicit we could have proliferated infinitely many copies of the empty set üò¨\n\nAt this point, there is a clear motivation for adding to the axiom toolkit some way of building new sets from existing ones, else we are stuck with the empty set! From here the narrative could go in one of two directions which I think are equally sensible:\n\nintroduce the power set axiom (declaring that the power set of a set is a set)\nintroduce union and pairing (this allows us to introduce the set that contains the empty set, in particular)\n\nBoth pathways allow us to construct sets of size k for any natural number k, and indeed this hints at the construction of the naturals (although we still don‚Äôt get the set of natural numbers without the infinity axiom). I am taking the first path because I think the notion of pairing is easy to trip on (I would very likely confuse it with the union).\nAfter power sets I do bring up unions and point out that we get intersections for free from specification and union. The narrative for this section almost ends here, although I am debating if this is already a good place to get into some of the rocky history of foundations, mostly drawing from the narratives carefully crafted in these videos by Veritasium, and borrowing some anecdotes from primary sources. One challenge about the historical aspect is that many parts of the narrative show up more in the other sections of this chapter, so I am debating between if I should chop up the history into small relevant chunks or if I should do it all at once at the end.\nThe section in its current state has no serious attempt at analogies. I am currently exploring thinking through a couple of options:\n\nI am wondering if it is reasonable to compare sets to boxes that contain things (their elements), as is done often. This is helpful in explaining why \\(\\emptyset\\) and \\(\\{\\emptyset\\}\\) are not the same set, for example: a box that contains nothing vs a box that contains a box that contains nothing. However, the axiom of extension tells us that for any set \\(a\\), the set \\(\\{a,a\\}\\) is just the set \\(\\{a\\}\\). So the box that contains two empty boxes, for example, is exactly the same as the box that contains one empty box. This feels rather odd and I am not sure I have an easy fix.\nI am really enjoying the garden analogy from The Magic Garden Of George B And Other Logic Puzzles by Raymond Smullyan. But it is a little too elaborate for a passing remark. I do wonder if it is reasonable to borrow the main ideas and present it as an extended exercise.\n\nWith numbers, we are going to more or less pick up from where we left off with sets, and look into the construction of the naturals (and possibly also the rationals and reals), and spend some time going over representation and bases. Representing numbers with symbols is something we have taken for granted since kindergarten, so it will be a challenge to convey why it‚Äôs somewhat mind-blowing that it can in fact be done. Here I do think a money-based analogy helps ‚Äî grouping coins and trading them for fewer coins of denominations, etc.\nOverall, number representation has a lot of fun (ancient) history and my main challenge will be to exercise restraint over what to cover. I would like to get into cardinality and infinity here, possibly describe a construction of the Cantor set (in elementary terms), and indeed I will bring up the axiom of infinity so we can define the set of natural numbers. However, I will postpone discussions about things like the Hilbert hotel to the next section‚Ä¶\n‚Ä¶which is about functions. Here the plan is to develop enough language to speak of the Shr√∂der-Cantor-Bernstein theorem and work out some applications. We will also talk about Hilbert‚Äôs hotel, and work through Cantor‚Äôs diagonalization proofs and close with a discussion of well-ordering and the axiom of choice (my excuse for positioning this discussion here is that AC deals with ‚Äúchoice functions‚Äù).\nNext up, relations: mainly here I want to talk about equivalence classes and emphasize that one can think of set theory as being the study of a binary relation \\(\\in\\) over sets. I might attempt a construction of the Vitali set here because it demonstrates (a) a surprising consequence of the axiom of choice and (b) employs the idea of equivalence classes in the construction. Other nice (preferably elemetnary) examples of applications of equivalence classes will be great!\nThe section on recurrences is possibly a tangential move here, but it seems remiss to omit the topic altogether and I can‚Äôt get it to fit in any of the other chapters. My bleak excuse here is that they are an important class of functions. I plan to borrow some examples from Concrete Mathematics (e.g, the Josephus problem), and talk about some other famous sequences like the Fibonacci and Hofstadter sequences. There seems to be a nice opportunity here to bring in ancient Indian math influences, so I plan to do that the best I can.\nWe wind up with a section on logic, which is often its own chapter in a typical DM book. Here we will mostly talk about propositional logic and hint at other logics, but the emphasis will be on rules of inference and the notions of soundness and completeness. The chapter would feel incomplete (ahem) without mention of Godel‚Äôs incompleteness theorems, so I will try to build up enough language to be able to state them.\n\n\nActivities\nSo far, I plan to include:\n\nNumber guessing trick with binary representations\n21-card trick to get a card to show up any place in the deck, using ternary representation\nBlack Vienna and variants for logic\nZendo for logic/sets\nEleusis for logic/sets\n\nPlease share any other activities/games you can think of, thanks!\nSuggestions welcome!"

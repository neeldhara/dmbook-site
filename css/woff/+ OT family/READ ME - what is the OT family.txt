MB Type: What is the OT Family?

*****

If you use Microsoft Office, or never heard of an OpenType feature, you needn’t read further. This is not for you.

Heliotrope has an OT family. The OT family is the same as the base family, but with all the styles unified under a single family name of Heliotrope OT.

Furthermore, all the typographic options, including small caps, are implemented as OpenType layout features (hence the OT suffix).

The OT family is intended as an option for those who use page-layout programs, CSS, or other apps with strong support for OpenType features.

For this reason, I don’t recommend using the OT family in Microsoft Office. It won’t explode, but many of the typographic features won’t be available, due to limitations of Office.

You can install the OT family alongside the ordinary families. They won’t conflict with each other and show up separately in your Font menu.

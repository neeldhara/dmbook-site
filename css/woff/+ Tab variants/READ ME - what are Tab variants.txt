MB Type: What are Tab variants?

Heliotrope has a Tab variant for each family. The Tab variant is the same as the base family, but with tabular figures as the default in each style.

(Tabular figures are figures that are equal width so that they align vertically in tables. Ordinarily, the default figures have different widths.)

If youâ€™ve never thought about tabular figures in your life, you can stop reading. Install the base family and enjoy.

You can install the regular family, the Tab family, or both. They will not conflict with each other and show up separately in your Font menu.

If you primarily use Microsoft Word, I recommend just installing the base family, because you can always access the tabular figures as a font-styling option from inside Word. (See the FAQ for more information.)

If you primarily use Microsoft Excel, I recommend installing the Tab family, because you cannot other access tabular figures any other way.

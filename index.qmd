Welcome to the companion website for the Discrete Mathematics textbook^[currently work in progress].

[I](https://www.neeldhara.com) look forward to feedback on the book as I try to cobble together a first draft over summer. My motivation for writing this book is mainly that teaching _Discrete Mathematics_ at the undergraduate level --- and related graduate-level courses like Combinatorics and Graph Theory --- has been one of the most rewarding experiences I've had. 

Discrete Mathematics at the undergraduate level is often taught with a dedicated tutorial slot. Over the years, I have had a lot of fun drawing inspiration from several sources to turn the tutorial sessions into hands-on activities. In particular, I've found that playing games, solving puzzles, discussing paradoxes, and performing card magic are engaging ways to revisit and apply ideas from the lectures.

The topics of this course also offer a good opportunity to appreciate historical context: the development of many things we now take for granted, whether number systems or paradox-inducing axioms, came about over long periods of deliberations and debate. The role of mathematicians in ancient India in some of these themes is also a matter of intrigue and beauty. 

Discrete Mathematics is often assigned to the semester where students are also introduced to some flavors of data structures and algorithms, which in turn usually has a lab component. I believe that with a little planning, it is possible to bring out synergies between these courses. 

Through this book I hope to bring out the elements that have made DM one of my favorite courses to teach. I will be rolling out a chapter every week over summer, starting from the 21st of April. There are seven chapters, each in two parts: the first covers core material that would be suitable for roughly four lectures, and while the extras cover additional trivia and sometimes advanced material suitable for self-study. This companion website will also be used to host interactive demonstrations for some of the activities in the book.
